              Competitive programming continues to be one of the best ways to
              improve your coding skills, logical thinking, and problem-solving
              ability. If you're planning to start in 2025, this guide is your
              starting point.

              ðŸ”¸ Learn a Coding Language Well
            </h3>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              Choose a language that's widely used in competitive coding â€” C++,
              Python, and Java are most popular. Make sure you understand the
              basics like loops, arrays, strings, functions, and input/output
              handling.
            </p>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              C++ is the most recommended due to its STL (Standard Template
              Library), which helps solve many problems faster with built-in
              data structures like sets, maps, and heaps.
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub_topics" style="padding-top: 10px">
              ðŸ”¸ Start with Beginner Platforms
            </h3>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              Begin with platforms that offer beginner-friendly problems like
              <code>Codeforces</code>, <code>LeetCode</code>,
              <code>CodeChef</code>, and <code>AtCoder</code>. These sites offer
              contests, editorial solutions, and a wide range of problems.
            </p>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              Your goal is not to solve hard problems at first â€” build
              confidence by solving easy ones regularly.
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub_topics" style="padding-top: 10px">
              ðŸ”¸ Learn Problem-Solving Patterns
            </h3>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              After solving basic problems, focus on common patterns like binary
              search, sliding window, recursion, and greedy algorithms. These
              are repeated frequently in contests.
            </p>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              You donâ€™t need to memorize solutions â€” understand how the patterns
              work, and implement them on different types of problems.
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub_topics" style="padding-top: 10px">
              ðŸ”¸ Practice Daily, Even 1 Problem
            </h3>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              Consistency beats intensity. Solving just one problem a day keeps
              you improving steadily. Track your progress and avoid long breaks.
            </p>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              Try contests on weekends to simulate the real environment and
              improve your speed under pressure.
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub_topics" style="padding-top: 10px">
              ðŸ”¸ Read Editorials After Trying
            </h3>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              Donâ€™t waste hours stuck on one problem. Give yourself time to try,
              and then read the editorial. Understand why your solution didnâ€™t
              work, and rewrite it with the new idea.
            </p>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              Reading and learning from mistakes is what helps you level up
              faster.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub_topics" style="padding-top: 10px">
              ðŸ”¸ Important Bonus Tip for You
            </h3>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              Create a GitHub repository or a private notes system where you
              write summaries of new tricks, failed attempts, and learned
              patterns. This personal knowledge base becomes extremely valuable
              over time.
            </p>
            <p class="page_paras" style="padding-block: 5px">
              Finally, don't compare your progress with others. Everyone has
              their own pace. Just keep showing up daily, and results will come.
            </p>
